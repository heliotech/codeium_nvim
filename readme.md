# codeium and nvim

Having a closer look at the codeium. I've just learned about codeium and wanted to give it a try.
VIM was too old, but NeoVim was up to the task, so the plugin was installed for NeoVim.

At first glance, the plugin is an excellent idea and it works well. Helps with tedious and repetitve tasks. Not only does it help with python, which was the primary goal, but with English, as well.

In summary: *codeium is to be recommended*.
